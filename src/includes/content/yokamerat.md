### Yokamerat

The newest edition of the site was my side project,
which I used to exercise responsive design
and development for Wordpress. The previous site was developed
by me and needed updating both in design, backend and usability aspects.

I built a theme that has custom post types for events and news making it
easier to update. While refining the code to make the site faster.

New stuff learnt during the development was using LESS, using
_underscores -framework and highly customize Wordpress.
