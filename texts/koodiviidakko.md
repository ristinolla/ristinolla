**When:** 2012 - 2013

**In short:** Lead front-end designer and developer in multiple projects. Including  e-commerce sites and UI design and development.

**Tech learnt:** jQuery, Viidakkostore, Sivuviidakko, Postiviidakko, HTML emails, Javascript filtering, CSS quirks, Photoshop

I worked as a lead front-end developer and lead designer in multiple project ranging from e-commerce and websites, to Javascript UIs and HTML newsletters. I started out as an intern and improved my developer skills really fast by leaps and bounds. In no time, I was able to handle complex website projects and guide new interns as well. In addition to basic front-end projects, I was trusted to develop more special and tailored solutions, such as Javascript UIâ€™s and designing UI for Intranet. I was also a key developer of a new Javascript product sorting plugin, which increased the speed of browsing products and decreased the server workload significantly.
