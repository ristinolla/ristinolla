**When:** 8/2014

Konseptitoimisto Nauha is a brand new concept office, which was the first case I did as freelancer. The site was designed to be simple, yet informative and modern. Minna Viitalähde did branding and graphic design, which laid a solid foundation for me to design the website to match the brand image that she created.

The site is build on Wordpress with a highly customized theme. Developed to be mobile-first responsive and have crisp images in every screen. As always, I try to learn some new techniques in each project and SVG imagery was the one in this one. In addition to the site, I took Mari's portrait and the background image.
