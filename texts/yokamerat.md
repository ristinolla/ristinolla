**When:** 1/2014

The newest edition of the site was my side project,
which I used to exercise responsive design and development for Wordpress. The previous site that was also developed by me, needed updating both in design, backend and usability aspects.

I built a new theme from ground up with high customization such as custom post types for events and news. The whole site was built on responsiveness in mind and keeping the site simple to be updated by anyone in the organization. 

New stuff I learnt during the development was using LESS in production site, using
_underscores -framework and customize Wordpress in greater extent.
