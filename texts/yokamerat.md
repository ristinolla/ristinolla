**When:** 1/2014

The newest edition of the site was my side project,
which I used to exercise responsive design and development for Wordpress. The previous site was developed by me and needed updating both in design, backend and usability aspects.

I built a theme with custom post types for events and news, making maintaining 
easier. The whole site was built on responsiveness in mind. 

New stuff learnt during the development was using LESS, using
_underscores -framework and highly customize Wordpress.
