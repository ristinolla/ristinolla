Hi! My name is Perttu Ristimella. I am a web developer and designer currently living in Helsinki, but born and raised in Finnish Lapland. I am passionate about responsive web design, semantic HTML and CSS, modern web technologies and development workflow. I appreciate beautifully designed and carefully crafted products and services. 

I have a fresh Master's degree in Engineering and Management from the University of Oulu. I majored in technology management and I had a lot of entrepreneurial studies. Although I minored in computer science, I consider myself as a self-taught in web developing. Ultimately, I try to combine my business studies and practical developer skills to create something outstanding and meaningful. 

Below you can see some of my work in web. Check out my [LinkedIn](http://fi.linkedin.com/in/pertturistimella/) -profile for more work experience and [Github](http://github.com/ristinolla/) for nerdier stuff.
