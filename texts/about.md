Hi! My name is Perttu Ristimella. I am a web developer and web designer currently living in Helsinki, but grew up in Finnish Lapland. My strengts are in front-end design and user experience. I am passionate about responsive web design, semantic HTML and CSS, modern web technologies and development workflow. I appreciate beautifully designed and carefully crafted products and services. 

I have a fresh Engineering and Management degree from the University of Oulum, where I majored in tecngology management and had a lot of entrepreneurial studies. Although I minored in computer science minor, I consider myself as self-taught in web developing. Ultimately, I try to combine my business studies and practical developer skills to create something outstanding and meaningfull. 

Below you can see some of my work in web so far.
