Hi! My name is Perttu Ristimella. I am a full-stack web developer and a designer living in Helsinki, but born and raised in Finnish Lapland. I am passionate about responsive web design, semantic HTML and CSS, modern web technologies and development workflow. I appreciate beautifully designed and carefully crafted products and services. My ultimate target is to combine my business studies and practical developer skills to create something outstanding and meaningful. Currently I'm working at [Gapps](http://www.gapps.fi).

Below you can see some of my work in the Internets. Check out my [LinkedIn](http://fi.linkedin.com/in/pertturistimella/) -profile for more work experience and [Github](http://github.com/ristinolla/) for nerdier stuff.
