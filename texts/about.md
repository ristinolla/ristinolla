# Hi, my name is Perttu.<br> I am a badass web developer, <br> who loves to take <a href="http://blog.pertturistimella.com" target="_blank">photos</a>.

I am a full-stack web developer and a designer currently based in Helsinki, but born and raised in Finnish Lapland. I am passionate about  web design, modern web technologies, development workflows, and agile team leading. I appreciate beautifully designed and carefully crafted products and services. My ultimate target is to combine my business studies and practical developer skills to create something outstanding and meaningful. Currently I'm working at [Gapps](http://www.gapps.fi) focusing on building the next big enterprise intranet, called [Universe](https://getuniverse.com).
